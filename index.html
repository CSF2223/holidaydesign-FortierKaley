        <h3>Dead Horse Caroling, Wales</h3>
        <p class="dhcText">You’re probably familiar with Christmas caroling, but you’re definitely not familiar with the carolers
        who might show up at your door in Wales. At some point in December or January, you could open your door to 
        find someone hidden by a ribbon and bell-adorned sheet, holding up a real horse skull on a stick, with a 
        few fellow revelers in tow. As part of this Mari Lwyd (“Gray Mare”) tradition, the group will sing to you 
        and then challenge you to a battle of rhyming insults in Welsh (called a pwnco). After the contest, the party 
        is usually invited inside for refreshments.</p>

        <h3>Hogmanay, Scotland</h3>
        <p class="hogText">Hogmanay is a raging New Year’s Eve bash with massive parties that last until January 2nd. 
        The holiday evolved from celebrating the winter solstice and incorporated elements from Samhain, 
        an ancient Gaelic holiday most akin to Halloween, which is still celebrated today. 
        Edinburgh plays host to the largest Hogmanay, starting with a massive torchlight procession on Dec. 30th. 
        Yes, actual fire is involved, as are drummers and bagpipers (because, Scotland).</p>

        <h3>Toji, Japan</h3>
        <p class="tojiText">Japan’s winter solstice is known as Toji, a low-key tradition that involves lighting bonfires on Mt. Fuji 
        and soaking in citrus-scented baths. But arguably, the best way to welcome the winter solstice is by visiting 
        an onsen (a natural hot spring) that’s filled with yuzu for the occasion. Fun fact: Yuzu is a type of sour 
        citrus fruit that looks like a lemon, but tastes more like a lime.</p>
